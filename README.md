It’s being here now that’s important. There’s no past and there’s no future. Time is a very misleading thing. All there is ever, is the now. We can gain experience from the past, but we can’t relive it; and we can hope for the future, but we don’t know if there is one.  
-- George Harrison

The more I expect, the more unhappy I am going to be. The more I accept, the more serene I am.  
-- Michael J. Fox

I think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy. Because they know what it feels like to feel absolutely worthless and they don't want anybody else to feel like that.  
-- Robin Williams
